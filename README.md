Young Adult Literacy Survey

    http://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/LITERACY_PROFILES.pdf Final Report
    Sampling Frame: Nationally representative household sample of 21- to 25-year-olds living in the 48 contiguous United States. 

National Adult Literacy Survey

    Sampling Frame: 13,600 individuals aged 16 and older during the first eight months of 1992. These participants had been randomly selected to represent the adult population in the country as a whole. In addition, about 1,000 adults were surveyed in each of 12 states that chose to participate in a special study designed to provide state-level results that are comparable to the national data. Finally, some 1,100 inmates from 80 federal and state prisons were interviewed to gather information on the proficiencies of the prison population. In total, over 26,000 adults were surveyed.
    Comparability YALS:  A national household survey of the literacy skills of young adults (aged 21 to 25) was conducted in 1985. Because the NALS also assessed young adults and readministered a set of tasks, it is possible to compare the literacy skills of individuals assessed in 1985 and those assessed in 1992 â€” including not only 21- to 25-year-olds but also 28- to 32-year-olds, who were 21 to 25 years of age in 1985.

Questions

Is the American stratification system becoming more efficient in allocating jobs based on cognitive ability, as Hernstein and Murray propose?

Do we need a big shift or a small shift at the margin in literacy to close income gap explainable by cognitive skills? Is the labor market based on absolute ability or relative ability?

When in a career does cognitive ability most affect compensation?

Can we characterize the occupations that are most and least responsive to cognitive ability?

Have educational credentials declined in their reliability as indicators of cognitive ability? Does this suggest measurement problems with using years of education across time?
